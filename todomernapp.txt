# 📝 ToDo List Application

A simple and responsive **ToDo List Application** built using **React** and **Bootstrap**, which allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The application communicates with a backend server to store and manage tasks effectively.

## 🚀 Features
- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks with a title and description.
- **View Tasks**: Display all tasks in a list format.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify task details directly.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks permanently.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The UI updates dynamically with changes.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with Bootstrap for styling.
- **Backend**: REST API for handling CRUD operations (placeholder URL: `http://localhost:8000`).
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5 for a responsive and user-friendly UI.
